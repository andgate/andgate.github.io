Supreme ruler of functional programming and frontend software architecture. I create worlds that matter. The whole frustum of being bows before the raw intensity only offered through my endless affordances. I have served brilliant flashes of light to over 1 million occipital lobes. I am passionate, driven, and enjoy a strong cup of black coffee. Currently looking for work. Please see my resume for more details.
